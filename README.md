# [CS 294: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Fall 2017](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

This repository contains homework assignments for CS294 Fall 2017 and implementations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

The required dependencies used include:

    TensorFlow 1.4.0
    [MuJoCo 1.50 - student license](http://www.mujoco.org/)  
    [Keras](https://keras.io/)
    [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
    
### Homeworks

* [HW 1](hw1): Imitation Learning
The goal of this assignment is to experiment with imitation learning, including direct behavior cloning
and the DAgger algorithm.


* [HW 2](hw2): The goal of this assignment is to experiment with policy gradient and its variants, including
variance reduction methods.

* [HW 3](hw3): This assignment requires you to implement and evaluate Q-Learning with convolutional neural networks for playing Atari games.

* [HW 4](hw4): The goal of this assignment is to get experience with model-learning in the context of RL,
and to use simple model-based methods (particularly, Model Predictive Control (MPC)) for
controlling agents.
